Clearing database:

In most of the RDBMS databases, delete commands will work with a condition which accepts exact 
values or pattern, and we can run delete queries by using non-primary key columns in where clause.
But in NoSQL databases, like Dynamo DB, we have to provide exact values in delete condition, and 
we must pass both primary key & range key values of each item.

According to the DynamoDB documentation you could just delete the full table.

See below:

"Deleting an entire table is significantly more efficient than removing items one-by-one, 
which essentially doubles the write throughput as you do as 
many delete operations as put operations"
